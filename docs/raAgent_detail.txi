@section raAgent Detail

Instances of this type execute whatever action is required
when an option is invoked.  The basic @code{raAgent} instance
has three members.

@node raAgent struct
@subsection raAgent struct

@example
typedef struct _readargs_agent
@{
   int args_needed;
   raReader reader;
   raWriter writer;
@} raAgent;
@end example

@itemize @bullet
@item int args_needed

This is usually either 0 or 1, representing a @emph{flag} option
that takes no arguments, or a @emph{value} option that does take
an argument.

For providing @option{--help} display, the library only considers
the value is zero or not.  A custom agent is free to use this
member to indicate something else.

@item raReader reader

This is a pointer to a function that processes the option value.
The function is called with a NULL @code{str} parameter for
flag options.

@item raWriter writer

This is a pointer to a function that writes the value of the
option.  This is only required if the developer intends to use
the function @code{ra_show_scene_values} to show the user
the effective option values.

@node Predefined Agents
@subsection Predefined Agents

There are several builtin agents for servicing different data
types.
